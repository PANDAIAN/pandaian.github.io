If those is not clear,please be understanding.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>To classmate:</strong> lei, I’ll break the agreement of that state enterprise.Because JD(JD airline company) tells me don’t seek job.The training may begin soon. So I planned to do it.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>To father:</strong> Dad, I planned to be a pilot, because this job is extraordinary prospect for me and I am lose interest in my major. I have passed all the physical examination and got a offer from JD airline.The training will be started soon.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>To Girlfriend:</strong> Dear，we’ll have married when I’ve finished the pilot lesson and became a really pilot. The pilot’s treatment is sure to give you a better lifestyle in this city.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>To relatives:</strong> Uncle，I wanna be a pilot, but there are necessary to put out lots of money to pay the training fee. Could you help me？ I can pay back that money in the future.</em></p>\n<p><strong>All this fantasy, I force myself to recognize the reality today.</strong></p>\n<p>Remember that I cut class to attend the polit physical examination in a chilly winter which was four years ago. Surprisingly,I passed it. My family held a long time meeting. Mom supposed  pilot is dangerous job and Dad supported me. He thinks a man should be ambitious.</p>\n<p>Maybe too young to simple, I naively believe passing the physical examination means that I will have been enrolled by CAFUC(Civil Aviation Flight University of China). Many girl who are my classmate actively talks with me.So that I coundn’t control myself and fell in love at those time.Obviously,finally I was fail in the last examination.<br>For the fail, It’s completely mistake of myself.</p>\n<p>She chose a university which’s local in hometown, and  I picked up a travelling bag going to Beijing for studying. But my university is not well so that I studied seriously for continueing to be a pilot when I  graduated.Only if I get a bachelor degree can I became a pilot.</p>\n<p>For catching up the dream which I had destroyed with my own hands, I have insisted to exercise and got scholarship for four years.I passed CET4 and CET6 at once,you shoud know that just one passed CET6 in my whole class. Now I also get a good score in the exam of IELTS.</p>\n<p>It’s luckily that HNA(Hainan Airline) was located on Beijing. I had waited for half a year，HNA didn’t published recruit yet.Time going fly, HNA published it near the spring festival.Although I known that HNA is in some troubles about finance, I still insisted on HNA is my first choose. Because  I believe a starved camel is still bigger than a horse, HNA is that camel.</p>\n","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Error Of iPhone Export Image or Video","url":"https://xmj.ch/2019/05/15/Error-of-iPhone-export-image-or-video/","content":"<p>Today, I wanna export images and videos from my iPhone.

Actually, Both InputStream and Reader are abstractions to read data from source, which can be either file or socket, but main difference between them is, InputStream is used to read binary data, while Reader is used to read text data, precisely Unicode characters. So what is difference between binary and text data? well everything you read is essentially bytes, but to convert a byte to text, you need a character encoding scheme. Reader classes uses character encoding to decode bytes and return characters to caller.</p>\n<p>Reader can either use default character encoding of platform on which your Java program is running or accept a Charset object or name of character encoding in String format e.g. “UTF-8”. Despite being one of the simplest concept, lots of Java developers make mistakes of not specifying character encoding, while reading text files or text data from socket.</p>\n<p>Remember, if you don’t specify correct encoding, or your program is not using character encoding already present in protocol e.g. encoding specified in “Content-Type” for HTML files and encoding presents in header of XML files, you may not read all data correctly. Some characters which are not present in default encoding, may come up as ? or little square.</p>\n<p>Once you know this fundamental difference between stream and reader, understanding difference between FileInputStream and FileReader is quite easy. Both allows you to read data from File, but FileInputStream is used to read binary data, while FileReader is used to read character data.</p>\n","categories":["Java"],"tags":["diary"]},{"title":"Writing in front of posts","url":"https://xmj.ch/2018/09/08/Writing-in-front-of-posts/","content":"<h1 id=\"Writing-in-front-of-posts\"><a href=\"#Writing-in-front-of-posts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Writing in front of posts\"></a>Writing in front of posts</h1><blockquote>\n<p>Writing some words in front of all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact,this is my first technical blog,first English blog also.
